REDUCE function applies a lambda value expression to each element in a list, perform cumulative calculations, and return a single value.


### Syntax

```gql
reduce(accumulator = initial_value, variable IN list | expression)
```

### Aggregate weights along PATH(s) in GQL

Suppose we are interested in the Uroosa's aggregated percentage in Hotel Kitchen Sink

<ubo_graph/>
We can use REDUCE as following:

```gql
match path = all (a:person {_id:'uroosa'})-[owns]->{0,} (b:business {_id:'hotel kitchen sink'})
return path, 
reduce(total_ownership = 1 , own in owns | total_ownership * own.percentage) as ownership
next 
return sum(ownership);
```

Note that we first mutiply Ownership percentages along each path and then the sum up the percentages for the 2 paths.
