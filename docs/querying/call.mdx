CALL statement in GQL invokes a Procedure

## For each node find the number of incoming edges


Suppose we are interested in the number of highways flowing into each of the Highway: 
<highway_network_graph/>

We can use the CALL statement to invoke and inline procedure as follows:

```gql
MATCH nodes = (b)
CALL {
  MATCH path = (a)-[e1:flows_to]->(b)
  return path
    , count(distinct e1) as incoming_nodes_count
    , COLLECT_LIST(distinct a.name) as incoming_nodes
}
return table(b.name, incoming_nodes_count, incoming_nodes)
order by incoming_nodes_count desc;
```
