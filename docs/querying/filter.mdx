title: "FILTER"
---

The `FILTER` statement selects a subset of the records of the current working table. It updates the current working table to include only the records that satisfy the specified search condition. Compare this to the [WHERE](/docs/querying/where) clause which allows selection of records during the [MATCH](/docs/querying/match) phase.
