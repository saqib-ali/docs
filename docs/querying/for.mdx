`FOR` statement unnests a list into individual records by iterating over its elements, allowing subsequent statements to process these elements one by one.

### Using FOR statement to iterate over each edge in a Quantified Path Pattern

Suppose we are interested in the all the hops required to go from Bayreuth to Santiago:

<travel_network_graph/>

We can use the FOR loop as following

```gql
match paths = any shortest  (a:city {_id:'Bayreuth'})-[edges:train|flight]->{1,}(b:city {_id:'Santiago'})
for edge in edges
return distinct table(edge._from, edge._to, labels(edge), pnodeIds(paths), length(paths));
```
We are using the FOR statement to unnest (decompose) the edges.
