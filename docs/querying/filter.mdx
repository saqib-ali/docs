title: "FILTER"
---

The `FILTER` statement selects a subset of the records of the current working table. It updates the current working table to include only the records that satisfy the specified search condition. Compare this to the [WHERE](/docs/querying/where) clause which allows selection of records during the [MATCH](/docs/querying/match) phase. The FILTER statement is applied after the precending statements have been executed. As such, it is most useful in refining the results further by applying additional conditions.
