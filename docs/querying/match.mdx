## Shortest Path

Find shortest path `path`, from a user `u1` to user `u2` traversing `:knows` edges 1+ (`{1,}`) times.

```gql
MATCH path = ANY SHORTEST (u1:users {username: "saqib"})-[:knows]->{1,}(t2:users {username: "uroosa"})
RETURN u1.username, u2.username, path_length(p) AS num_hops
```

## Expressing complex queries using Multiple Paths

Find a pair of friends in the same city (`(y.city = x.city)`) who transfer money (`(account_x)−[t1:transfer]−>(account_z)−[t2:transfer]−>(account_y)`) to each other using a common friend who lives elsewhere (`(x.city<>z.city)`).

```gql
MATCH (x:account_holder)−[:friends]−>(y:account_holder)−[:friends]−>(z:account_holder)−[:friends]−>(x:account_holder)
, (x)−[:owns]−>(account_x)
, (y)−[:owns]−>(account_y)
, (z)−[:owns]−>(account_z)
, (account_x)−[t1:transfer]−>(account_z)−[t2:transfer]−>(account_y)
FILTER (y.city = x.city) AND (x.city<>z.city)
RETURN x.name AS name1, y.name AS name2
```

This pattern consists of five path patterns, separated by a commas. In GQL, the comma performs a logical join on the results of the two path patterns.
